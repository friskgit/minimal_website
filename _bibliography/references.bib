                  Intuition (GI) hosted by the Norwegian Academy of
                  Music in Oslo, this article discusses the aesthetics
                  of improvising with machines.  Playing with a system
                  such as the one described in this article, with
                  limited intelligence and no real cognitive skills,
                  will obviously reveal the weaknesses of the system,
                  but it will also convey part of the preconditions
                  and aesthetic frameworks that the human improviser
                  brings to the table. If we want the autonomous
                  system to have the same kind of freedom we commonly
                  value in human players’ improvisational practice,
                  are we prepared to accept that it may develop in a
                  direction that departs from our original aesthetical
                  ambitions? The analyses is based on some of the
                  documented interplay between the musicians in a
                  group in workshops and laboratories. The question of
                  what constitutes an ethical relationship in this
                  kind of improvisation is briefly discussed. The
                  aspect of embodiment emerges as a central obstacle
                  in the development of musical improvisation with
                  machines.}

  Title =        {Music for a Better Life},
  Year =         2011,
  abstract =     {With its urgent experimental narrative and exquisite
                  imagery, Better Life is a film with immediate
                  appeal. Thematically, it has many links to our own
                  artistic practice, but our first contact with the
                  film raised several questions concerning the form
                  for our collaboration with Isaac Julien. Firstly:
                  isn’t this a completed work? Where is the scope for
                  new music to change or complement the perspective
                  for this elegantly formulated totality? And how
                  could the ambient sounds, the voice-over text and
                  existing music soundtrack be incorporated in our
                  adaptation?  In contrast to the notion of a fixed
                  work, defined by one solitary (usually male)
                  originator – a concept that is linked in western art
                  music to the score’s authoritarian definition of the
                  work’s identity – music, as a socially defined
                  phenomenon, can be a platform where we create
                  shared, common cultural meanings. The various levels
                  at which we create, interpret and share the
                  experience of musical “works” forms the basis for an
                  understanding of what Umberto Eco calls a “work in
                  movement”. Perhaps the most important change that
                  has taken place in this new understanding of the
                  musical work is the shift in focus from the score
                  and the fixed work to the encounter with a diversity
                  of listeners.  Our meeting with Isaac in London last
                  June developed into an opening and a natural
                  continuation of our own ongoing project. He
                  immediately declared that he was less interested in
                  finalised works (products) than in the development
                  of a work over time, through new versions. This gave
                  us a common platform that we could use to approach
                  the various audio and visual elements of the film as
                  being in part mutually independent. The music of a
                  scene could be replaced by new sounds, while
                  environmental sounds could be kept or processed;
                  concrete sounds as abstract, musical units.}

@article{Frisk2005,
	Abstract = {In this article we discuss the notion of
                  "interaction", "participation" and "the public" in
                  artistic work, specifically within the context of
                  the exhibition The Invisible Landscapes (curated by
                  Miya Yoshida, Malmo Konstmuseum, 2003) and
                  etherSound (created by Henrik Frisk), a sound
                  installation displayed in that exhibition. In this
                  work the audience is invited to participate in the
                  creation of new sound events by sending text
                  messages from their mobile phones. Thus, our
                  discussion is focused on the space and the mode of
                  participation opened up by new communication
                  technology. Based on our experiences of that
                  project, we introduce and explain what we believe
                  are relations of creative production and a different
                  kind of creativity that may emerge from active
                  interaction. We also attempt to describe what we
                  believe an implementation of active public
                  participation can lead to. We are combining two
                  modes of thinking in this article; one is inspired
                  by a discourse of cultural theories and the other by
                  reflection on our experience of the event. The
                  latter is, by definition, rather subject centred and
                  expansive based on individual observation. We
                  examine and analyse the phenomenon of
                  "participation" whilst playing etherSound as a
                  process of creative production, and seek to reflect
                  upon the power of the co-operative practice and its
                  relation to participation and creativity. },

  abstract =     {This paper provides a study of a cooperative
                  learning workshop which invited composers,
                  musicians, and designers to investigate electronic
                  sound instruments from the history of the Royal
                  College of Music in Stockholm (KMH) and EMS
                  Elektronmusikstudion in Stockholm. The workshop
                  applied Media Archaeology methods towards analyzing
                  one particular instrument from the past, the Dataton
                  System 3000, and Design Fiction methods towards
                  imagining several speculative instruments of the
                  future. Each section revealed very specific utopian
                  ideas surrounding the design of sound
                  instruments. Here, we lay out the intellectual,
                  material, and social conditions of the workshop,
                  along with a selection of the workshop's outcomes,
                  and some reflections on their significance for the
                  NIME community. By presenting this
                  method-in-progress, our hope is to inspire dialog
                  around the premise that the linked examination of
                  historical electronic sound technology's affordances
                  and ethics may bear rich fruit for contemporary
                  instrument design practices.},
