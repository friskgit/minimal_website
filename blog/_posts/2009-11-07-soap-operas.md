Browsing the web for Soap Opera content for our Sucktion performance I came across this particularly funny clip:

<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kgJT11-s70k&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&feature=player_embedded&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kgJT11-s70k&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&feature=player_embedded&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

What strikes me about this passage is how it reveals something about the attention span of the dialogue of the drama. The lead character claims to have made the move from "waiting tables" to the CEO of the company in just 13 weeks. That is quite an achievement.
