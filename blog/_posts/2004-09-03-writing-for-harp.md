I have finally started writing the score for the harp piece. The one thing I am still struggling with is to find the right connection between the harp and the computer on the 'gestalt' level. When it comes to the interaction I have decided, at least for now, to make the computer part a through-composed part triggered (possibly simply through beat tracking) by the harp part.

More will follow on this subject. For this piece, I will try to make notes here about the progress as the piece unfolds. Let's see if I dare to follow it through.
