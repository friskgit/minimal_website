When improvising, what is it I want to be free from? On what conditions do I feel free to express myself unrestricted? What is freedom in improvisation? Is unrestricted expression much desired?


I believe that the restrictions or limitations imposed on the choices at hand must come from within the expression in every given moment and not from an externally defined set of rules or practice. If that is true, then free means free from prejudice based on style and free from idiomatic choices. I also think that there is a paradoxical relationship between <cite>free</cite> and <cite>structured</cite> in that structure is a prerequisite for freedom<ins title="Note to myself: compare this with Derrida's article on Husserl discussing genesis and structure. Can any of those thoughts be applied to the relationship between improvisation and structure?"></ins>.
