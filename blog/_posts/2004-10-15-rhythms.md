I have not been posting for some time which is the result of not having had so much time for my work recently (I have been spending most of it together with my now 19 months old son...).

I am still working on the structure of the harp piece and I wanted to make a structural connection between the rhythms and the my tone series. I am now experimenting with using the same transformations that I use for the tone series for a serialized series of rhythms. It turned out to be quite useful for certain effects, such as speeding up and slowing down and complex, non-static polyrhythms.

However, it is quite obvious that rhythms do not translate well to serialization (as discovered by the serialists in Darmstadt fifty years ago). I will continue to work on this the next couple of days and see if I can find an angle to this that can work for this piece.
