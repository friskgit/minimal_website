I'm making very slow progress on the Harp piece - not because I don't know how to proceed but because so many other things are taking time away from composing. After the meeting with Mercedes Gomez, for whom I'm writing, I have a much clearer conceptual idea of the instrument and of her sound. Right now I have the feeling if I only could get four weeks uninterrupted, I'd be finished with this piece.
