A day of frustration... Spending most of my tme trying to set up my studio for editing physical modelling instruments for the harp piece. Succeeded at last...

The last few days I have read my collegue <a href="http://www.seeandseen.net/">Matts Leiderstam</a>'s transcript of an email conversation he has had with . It made me think of composing and playing as a mirror reflection of the self - maybe not a revolutionary thought in itself. However, as suggested in the text, not only does the mirror relflection tell you something about what is seen, but also who sees it. When that thought is transferred to music it becomes interesting; composing music to allow the listener to "see" herself. And further, when applied to interactive computer music specifically, the computer part could allow the <cite>musician</cite> to hear herself in the audible reflection in the computer part.
