After some time of inactivity I will resurrect this blog. It will still have a focus on the artistic research in music I do at the <a href="https://www.kmh.se/in-english.html">Royal College of Music in Stockholm</a> and related topics. Current research projects involve the Musical Transformations project for which I was recently in Vietnam.
