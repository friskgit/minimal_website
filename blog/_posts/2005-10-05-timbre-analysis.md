Today I finally had a chance to watch a decent display of the data outputted by my implementation of a critical band filter convolved with a amplitude spectrum generated by a fast fourier transform (FFT). The actual filter transformation I wrote almost two years ago, but due to other work getting in the way, it isn't until now I have had a chance to implement a graphical display of the spectrum and actually test it. It works well with real time input and, as far as I can tell after a few short tests, it is relatively invariant to pitch and discriminates well between vowels. In other words; it behaves as I had hoped it would.


This feels like a major break through in the part of my project that deals with the more technical, hands on, aspect of timbre based interaction. It will be very interesting to patch in <a href="http://dphs10.saclay.cea.fr/Spp/Experiences/OPAL/opalcern/nnbegin.html">JetMap</a> (an ANN implementation) and see what kind of results we might get from that. However, I will begin with making some overall adjustments and optimizations in the code and combine all the parts into one piece with a simple GUI to control all the parameters. Also, I should add a threshold to descriminate signal from noise (i.e. signal from no signal) and optimizations of the input vector (subtration of the average from all bins and perhaps normalization).



I will post some more data here within the next few weeks.
