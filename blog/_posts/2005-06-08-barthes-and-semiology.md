Is this not just the same problem as with the analysis and understanding of music as some will claim can only be done when it is notated (founded on a system of digital units). I will argue that relevant information and understanding can be extracted from the sound of the music without having to go through the transcription whether this transcription is constructed from the sound or whether it is the origin of the sound.
