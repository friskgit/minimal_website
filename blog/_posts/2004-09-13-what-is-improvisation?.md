I have frequently used the term improvisation without being very clear about what I mean. Obviously, improvisation can take on many different meanings. I will not attempt to make an inventory of musical improvisation concepts, but I will need to define my own concepts.

I am at the beginning of a very busy week, so I will not do it now, but in future posts, when I use the term <acronym title="As I think about it, and not as a general concept">improvisation</acronym>, I mean it as I think about it, and I will specify when I talk about improvisation in general terms.
