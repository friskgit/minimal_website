On April 9 I played a concert together with Per Anders Nilsson at CRMA at Stanford, Palo Alto in California, US. This was the last concert in a series of six concerts that we did together during the spring.


I am playing saxophone and laptop and Per Anders is playing laptop. We are both generating material as well as processing each others outputs. Listen to the full concert either streaming (requires a minimum bandwidth of 128 kbps) through QuickTime or RealOne by downloading the corresponding media file or download the mp3 encoded files. There are six tracks altogether. Depending on your system you may have to force QuickTime to open the SMIL file by right clicking and choosing "open with QuickTime" or similar. Please <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&amp;id=cntct&amp;about=1">let me know</a> if you are having trouble playing these files.
