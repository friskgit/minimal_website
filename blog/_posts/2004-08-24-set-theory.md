In my searches for references and articles I keep on finding texts relating to set theory and logic. This may very well be a coincidence, or it could be that I am appealed to looking at the <ins title="The attempt to integrate acoustical instruments played live with computer based instruments on several levels">problem</ins> in a way that relates to set theory (that I know I am). After all, logic is a science that includes both philosophy and mathematics, much like music and much like computers and <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>.


I have defined the problem in a dichotomous context of analog/digital. An alternative classification that lends itself to a tree like representation is that of body/mind. What makes this interesting to me is that the problem then becomes just a special case of the sort of dualism that is ever present in any action.
