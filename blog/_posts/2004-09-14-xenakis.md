I am back in Sweden after an interesting visit to Minsk, Belarus for an appearence at the international performance festival <a href="http://navinki.smufsa.nu/2004/index_en.htm">Navinki</a>. I will post some documentation from this trip on my <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?id=news">site</a>.

I have started reading a famous and very interesting book by composer, architect and music theorist Iannis Xenakis <i id="Xenakis, Iannis" title="Formalized Music : thought and mathematics in composition" class="Pendragon Press" style="1963, Revised edition" dir="Harmonologia series No. 6">Xenakis, 1963</i>. I don't have much to say about it at this point, but I am sure I will comment more on it in the near future.
