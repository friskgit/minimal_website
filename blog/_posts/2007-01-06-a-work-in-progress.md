Following <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?id=docs&field=id&query=15">this</a> link, you can download an article I've written that will soon be published in <a href="http://www.djmt.nl/">The Dutch Journal of Music Theory</a> (there's actually an <a href="feed://www.djmt.nl/d/djmt/djmt.rss">RSS feed</a> too). Apart from presenting my project and some thaughts that I have about it I also touch upon the issue of research method for practice based research.
