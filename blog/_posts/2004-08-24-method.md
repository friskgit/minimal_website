What would be the best format to present my artistic process? Can it be described in text, that is, can it be removed from, in my case, the music? I think not, it has to be presented whith a direct reference to the sounding object (which makes sense in my project since it is about dealing with the <cite>sound</cite> rather than the representation of the sound).

What is the outcome of the artistic process other than the artifact? It's easy enough to describe what has been done but difficult to exlain why it has been done. The results of my research can not be separated from my subjective choices and preferences and for these I have to take responsibility.

Next question: What are my preferences that have led me to pursue this project?
