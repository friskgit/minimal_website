I will need to try to make a priority list for the fall. The first thing coming up is the seminar with Stefan at MalmÃ¶ Academy of Music. However, the preparation for that shoudn't take to long since I am goning to give the same presentation as I intended to do for the last spring seminar at the Art Academy.


A list of the projects I am involved in:
<ul>
<li>Rewriting and translation to English of the <cite>etherSound</cite>-article. This should really be my first priority.</li>
<li>Get the implementation of JetNet together in order to start testing it and evaluate the Kohonan <acronym title="Artificial Neural Network">ANN</acronym> for timbre recognition.</li>
<li>Prepare for the trip to Minsk</li>
<li>Get the scetches for the harp piece ordered and decide whether to postpone the composing until the JetNet implementation is up and running.</li>
<li>Start discussions with Stefan about guitarr piece.</li>
<li>Get my site (including this blog) finished and published</li>
</ul>


That's all I can think about for now.
