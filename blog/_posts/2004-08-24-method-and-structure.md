I have, and has had since the spring, a feeling of total chaos - unordered thoughts and ideas travelling unstructured paths through my brain. But maybe things aren't that bad after all. Just looking through my notes and my slides that I did in preparation for the May seminar I realize I have produced something of value - however intangible it may seem.

What I should look more at is the ways I can structure my work. Not so much in order to present it to the outside, but in order for myself to start seeing new connections between the different areas of my work. The maps that I produced for the seminar can have relevance in this endavour (click image for a larger version).
