Find the notes for the introduction to the seminar on "Repetition Repeats all other Repetitions - a version for 'Symphonie Diagonale' by Viking Eggeling" <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?id=docs&field=id&query=16">here</a>. Here's a summary:



In January of this year myself and Stefan &Ouml;stersj&ouml; made a
version of <a
href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=9&show=1#9">Repetition
Repeats all other Repetitions</a> for the classic dadaist film <a
href="http://www.rooke.se/diasymf/diagonal3.html">Symphonie
Diagonale</a> by Swedish artist <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Eggeling">Viking
Eggeling</a>. From a music point of view it's a very odd project and
an example of a (not widely used) collage-like artistic work
method. It's basically the one thing (an existing piece of music) put
on top of the other (an art video from the 20's) with minor
adjustments to the music. What is it that makes this interesting?
