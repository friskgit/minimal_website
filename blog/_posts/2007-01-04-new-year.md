Last year I wasn't very active writing on this blog. When I wasn't travelling (which I did a lot of) my two sons took up most of my time. No time for blogging. Lot's of things going on though... Hopefully, this year I will be able to more actively log my activities and thoughts. I am getting closer to my dissertation (March 2008) so this year will be hectic.
