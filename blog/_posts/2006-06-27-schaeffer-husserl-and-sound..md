Since my PhD project is investigating sound and timbre as a means of interaction, phonomenology in general is of great interest to me. When reading Husserl's text "Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft" <i id="Husserl, Edmund" title="Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft" class="Vittorio Klosterman GmbH" style="Frankfurt am Main, 1965 (1911)">Husserl, 1911</i> I was struck by how many of the ideas expressed in this early text are closely related to the discussions on methodology in artistic research.
