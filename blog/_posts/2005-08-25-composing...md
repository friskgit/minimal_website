I'm spending all of my time working on the commission for a harp and computer piece. In the process I am also making the move away from using Finale for notation to using the OpenSource music typesetter <a href="http://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a>. It is a very diferent way of working. LilyPond is a text markup language that produces wonderfully looking score - that is, once you are familiar with the syntax. Most of the stuff can be changed and tweaked but it's pretty far from Finale's WYSWYG style of working. I will eventually start posting some examples here so, if you start feeling tired of paying money to be a beta tester to Coda Music and Finale, take a look here in a few weeks and learn more about LilyPond and the wonderful world of all text files!
