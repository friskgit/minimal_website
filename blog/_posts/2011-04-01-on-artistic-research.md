<a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415581691/">The Routledge Companion to Research in the Arts</a>, to which I have contributed the chapter "Time and Interaction: research through non-visual arts and media", co-written with one of the two editors of the book, Henrik Karlsson, has been reviewed by Johan Verbeke, head of Sint-Lucas School of Architecture in Brussels. I'm very happy to see that he summarizes his review with the words: "In view of the quality of the chapters as well as the overall  diversity and content of the book, it is difficult to find some weak spots."
