In a EC funded project by French saxophonist Guillaume Orti will select twelve members for a European saxophone ensemble. If you are interested vist <a href="http://www.european-saxophone-ensemble.eu">www.european-saxophone-ensemble.eu</a>. Stéphane Payen is among the composers who will compose for the ensemble so this should be real interesting.
