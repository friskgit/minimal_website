As an improvisor I have always tried to work with the musical material in a way that resembles composition and as a composer I try to create set up the conditions necessary for a non-static music. This would be the reason I am so interested in bringing in the computer as an interactive part in the performance. The computer can act in a dynamic way according to principles that I have set up, but also in real time adjust the decisions according to current input. The combined efforts of the performer and the computer becomes a combination of the static formalism of the score and the structured improvisation within one system. 

Ultimately this works both for composed music, where it brings dynamic aleatorial elements into the performance, and for improvised music where it aids structured forms and long term evolvement of musical material.
