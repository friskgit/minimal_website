This is a video from the same concert as <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/music/archives/2010/01/henrik_frisks_p.html">this previous post</a>. Here a quartet formed out of the ten piece band (me on tenor, Samuel HÃ¤llqvist on guitar, Nils Ã–lmedal on bass, and Peter Nilsson on drums)  is performing my piece <it>Friday Intro</it>. As is hinted at by the title <it>Friday Intro</it>, is an introduction to another piece (<it>Friday 13/3</it>) which we played immediately following this one in the concert. I'm really impressed by the way the rhythm section plays the rubato time yet keeping up with the relatively swift harmonic progression.
