This is just a <a href="http://www.integralive.org/repertoire-migration/migration-blog/migrating-manipulation-iii-by-miklos-maros">reference</a> to an entry in the <a href="http://www.integra.org/integra">Integra</a> migration blog that I posted tonight. My own involvement in the <a href="http://www.integra.org/integra">Integra</a> project is strating to feel quite exciting. I think we have some excellent ideas going on and we will also work together with many other interesting projects, like <a href="http://www.jamoma.org/">Jamoma</a> to only mention one.
