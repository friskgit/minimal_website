This is the version that Stefan premiered at the opening concert of the <a href="cemc.ccom.edu.cn/">MusicAcoustica 2006</a> festival in Beijing on October 23. This recording however was made in Malm&ouml;, in the composition studio at the <a href="http://www.mhm.lu.se">Malm&ouml; Academy of Music</a>. It should be noted that this is only one, and the first, <em>version</em> of this piece. It's a collaborative project between myself and Stefan and it has just started. The next performance will be in Malm&ouml; on December 10 at <a href="http://www.jeriko.info">Jeriko</a>.
