Today myself and <a href="http://www.flatness.net/">Miya Yoshida</a> finished our paper on etherSound in the context of <em>The Invisible Landscapes</em>. Hopefully we will get it published, and I will soon put it up on my site for download.


It has been an interesting experience for many reasons. Miya, coming from the field of visual arts, has a different angle on writing and thinking than what I have. But mainly, it has been incredibly valuable to discuss how to explain and reflect upon subjective experiences. After all, if cannot suceed in doing that, there really is no point in artistic research. I cannot tell if we did suceed in this article, but we have at least started a process.
