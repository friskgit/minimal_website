Working on our new film, Anders Elberling and I talk a lot about the impact of sound on vision. What is audiovisual interaction? What is synchronicity? Our method, now as well as before, has been to discuss the concepts and intentions with the project, and again, it is striking how well our material works in relation to the ideas we have discussed.

The questions remains, what is the nature of the relation between sound and image? What is it that creates unity between sound and image?
