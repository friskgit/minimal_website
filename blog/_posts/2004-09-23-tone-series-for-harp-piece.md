I think I have finally managed to construct a managable scheme for the 750 notes long tone series I am using for this composition. As soon as I have tested it some more, I will post an example here.

The first few bars of the piece is coming along. The sounds that I work with for the computer part has given me some new ideas for the the shaping of the (melodic) ideas.
