I started looking at different ways in which the soprano can "perform" on the vacuum cleaner in Anne LeBaron's Opera Sucktion. One option would be to let Marja, who is doing the soprano part, use a Wii controller that I then map unto some parameters of some part of the synthesis. Another option would be to rig the vacuum cleaner that is a part of the performance, with contact microphones and let the sound input from these microphones control aspects of the sound synthesis. This latter option is perhaps my preferred one, also because it will, I believe, more easily integrate into the general vibe of the piece.
