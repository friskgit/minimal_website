Continued from August 21.


So, if sound is the object, than the composition is not finished until it has been performed. The performance is no longer a realization of the score but rather a continuation of the composition process. This makes the interpreter part of the composition process and every new interpretation (and every performance) a recomposition. Does this view alter the role of the composer and what effect might it have on the decisions involved?
