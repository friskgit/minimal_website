The seminar me and my collegue Stefan Ã–stersjÃ¶ did today triggered some interesting discussions. I think that the connection we have found between interpretation (Stefan's subject) and improvisation proved to be a fruitful one and a path that can lead us into new territories.

Two questions that I received today are especially worth following up. The first one concerns my proposed model of the the specific case of a music for performer(s) and computer as two separate systems connected by the mode of interaction between them. The question was something like: <cite>If the integration is successful and the two systems merges inte one, what will be the nature of this higher class?</cite>The second one concerned my proposition that pitch and sound are of different logical types and was something like: <cite>What is the relation between the smallest identifiable sonic event (information about a specific event) and the whole (information about the general case)?</cite>

I don't have answers to any of these questions yet, but I believe I need to look into it. These questions can be exactly what I need to focus on right now, in order to get along with this aspect of my work.
