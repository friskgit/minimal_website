Currently working on a very interesting project with visual artist <a href="http://www.ebbabohlin.se/">Ebba Bohlin</a>. We are doing an installation at the <a href="http://domeofvisions.se/?gclid=Cj0KEQiArJe1BRDe_uz1uu-QjvYBEiQACUj6oq2eTYAswfsL2oiNoyWHGbfiv4hoRtthqBKLkkAD60oaAnLS8P8HAQ">Dome of Visions</a> at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH</a> on trees: the sleeping tree, the hibernating tree, the burning tree, the re-growing tree. One aspect of this at the space will be a pair of binoculars looking out on the trees in front of the DoV. 

I immediately had an idea of recording the sound from high up above the DoV and simultaneously at the ground level. Taking the spectral difference between this two, I imagined, would create a kind of glass-like, distant sound environment. Today I did some recordings and tested it, and it really works the way I thought!

I still need to figure out how to work with it, turn it into a meaningful sonic environment, but it's a good start.
