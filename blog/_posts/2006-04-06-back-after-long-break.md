I'm back after a long period of inactivity in this diary. Mainly, it has been due to the birth of our second son in November of last year. Bruno is now 5 months old and our lives are slowly finding its new routines.


One of the things I have been working on this winter is the <a href="http://www.integralive.org/integra">Integra project</a>. It's a project supported by the European Comission geared towards making performance of music with welements of live electronics more stable and easier for the new music ensembles to realize without having unlimited access to specialized expertise. I recently put together a document with some ideas I have and that I've developed as a result of the discussions in the group. The document can be found <a href="/assets/files/documentsIntegra/DevelopmentSuggestion.html">here</a>.
