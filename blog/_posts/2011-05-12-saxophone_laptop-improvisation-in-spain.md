Here's a video excerpt from a performance i did in Spain in early 2010. The concert took place in gallery Xavier Fiol in downtown Palma at the opening of my good freind Stefan Lundgren's show Crucifixions. A work from this show, The Medallion, is on the <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=disc&about=1&field=id&query=15">cover of lim's new CD</a>.
