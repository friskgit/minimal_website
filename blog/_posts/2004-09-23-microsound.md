I was recommended the book <cite>microsound</cite> by Curtis Roads <i id="Roads, Curtis" title="microsound" class="Massachusetts Institute of Technology" style="2001" dir="">Roads, 2001</i> and I have now started reading it. Obiously, it draws on some of the concepts introduced by Xenakis in <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/diary/bibliography.html"><cite>Formalized Music</cite></a>, but this is a much more thorough investigation of the concept of microsonic particles. It is of great interest to me since the idea that sound consists of particles rather than continous waveforms <cite>dissolve the rigid bricks of music architecture</cite> [<a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/diary/bibliography.html">Roads, 2001 - Introduction</a>].
