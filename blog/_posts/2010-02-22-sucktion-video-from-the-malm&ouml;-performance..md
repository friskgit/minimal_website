An excerpt of <a href="http://www.annelebaron.com/">Anne LeBaron</a>'s cyberopera <em>Sucktion</em> is now available as a streaming video from the <a href="http://www.mhm.lu.se">MalmÃ¶ Academy of Music website</a> for streaming media: <a href="http://gallery.me.com/mhmgalleri#100099">http://gallery.me.com/mhmgalleri#100099</a>. Unfortunately it does not seem to be possible for me to embed it so you will have to follow the link above if you want to listen.



I think Marja-Lisa, the soprano in the performance, is doing a wonderful job and I truly enjoy listening back to what we did with this fantastic piece of art. You can read more about my preperations for this performance and about Sucktion in general in my other blog: <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/diary/archives/2009/10/sucktion_a_cybo.php">Sucktion: A Cyborgopera by Anne LeBaron</a>; <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/diary/archives/2009/11/sucktion_laying.php">Sucktion: laying out the files</a>; <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/diary/archives/2009/11/vacuum_cleaner.php">Vacuum cleaner performance</a>.
