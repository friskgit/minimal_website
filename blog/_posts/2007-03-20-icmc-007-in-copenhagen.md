The <acronym title="International Computer Music Conference">ICMC</acronym> in 2007 will be held in Copenhagen this year. As somebody who works extensively with computers and improvisation (in combination that is) I am very honored to have been appointed one of the many ambassadors for this years conference. The work involved in being an ICMC ambassador is mainly communicative - in other words, you can direct questions or suggestions for the conference to me, either by contacting me by email (see the letter icon above for contact info) or by posting on this site.



I would especially be interested in hearing from musicians <em>outside</em> of the academic circles, and younger musicians working with computers in the context of improvisation. But obviously, anybody is more than welcome to get in touch with me regarding ICMC (or otherwise...). So, please spread the word and check out the following sites:
