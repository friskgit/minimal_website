This is a performance of my interactive improvisation environment etherSound (read the <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=2&show=1#2" alt="etherSound programme note">programme note</a>) at ICMC 2008 in Copenhagen. The performance took place at Huset - a small concert space in the centre of Copenhagen. 



The sounds that are a result of received SMS' are easily identified; they have a bell like character in combination with a stuttering speach like sound. The first message arrives 10:15 into the concert. As can be seen on the video a small instruction on how to participate was projected on the wall behind the stage. Unfortunately, an this is my mistake, the instructions were too short. Due to this half of the messages received during the performance were empty and didn't result in any sounds being enerated. However, the messages that did have content have a clear impact on the music (note in particular the message that ends the concert).
