The possibility to record music has had an enormous impact on music listening, on the music industry (or rather, it <em>created</em> the music industry) and on the composing and production of all kinds of music. The most recent formats for distibuting music are closely related to the personal computer (most notably CD's and mp3 files). I think this is the way to look at the computer in this context<ins title="The context being computer music."></ins>; a customizable and expanded playback unit.

Whithin it, it can contain instruments (synthesis engines and sample playback software) that it plays back according to instructions, communicated either through live input or through pre-programmed instructions. It cannot yet qualify as a performer from what I have seen been done. Certainly, for my music and for my artistic goal, I am not interested in it being a performer.
