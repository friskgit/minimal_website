Just as I finished the paper co-written with Miya Yoshida, I have to start editing and touching up my own article on etherSound. It is not easy to shift perspectives and now suddenly focus on the musical aspects of the piece, rather than the esthetic and general concept of it. After a long day of work I think i am starting to get a grip on it, and as usually, I am ending up rewriting most of it.


One problem that I have, and that I have to deal with, is that I feel like I have to reference every statement I make with a citatation. I have to be strong and stand for my own ideas, and use citations only when necessary to make a point.
