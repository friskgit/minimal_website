On November 13 I will perform in a staging of <a href="http://www.annelebaron.com/">Anne LeBaron's</a> Cyborgopera <em>Sucktion</em>. I will perform the laptop part which, interestingly enough, is written adding in a lot of freedom for me as a performer. The way the part is written, with a mixture of pre-prepared material, instructions for improvisations, and instructions on how to use material from the other performers (soprano and percussion), gives me a lot of liberty.




I have started looking for sounds and tools to use for my performance. I will continue using the Korg NANOpad which I bought recently for my Guelph Jazz Festival performance in September as it will be the perfect controller for the Sucktion laptop part. I will use build the main interface using Pd and use the Hexter and Bristol DSSI plugins for some of the MIDI sounds. The Thermin like sounds used, in particular in Scene I, I think I will create as small Pd sub-patches, possibly pitchtracking live input.




I will make stuff available here as I go along, as long as the composer will not object against it.
