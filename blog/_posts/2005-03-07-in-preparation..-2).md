(continuation from <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/diary/archives/2005/03/in_preparation.php">In preparation for a seminar...</a>


If the connection between input and output is too obvious the result is predictable and, while it may still be effective, will soon loose expressive quality. Having said this, the possibility to alter the timbre of an acoustic instrument in real time by having a computer simply follow the performer in pitch and time should not be underestimated. On the other hand, if the interaction is completely erratic and unpredictable there is little point in it being interactive in the first place. A quasi random event generator may do just as well. It will have to be the artistic intent of the music <em>and</em> of the interaction that rules how the connection between input and output should be manifested.
