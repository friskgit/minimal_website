<p>
Vector Hack is a biennial international festival devoted to experimental
analog vector graphics and led by Derek Holzer, an interesting artist and PhD researcher in the project <i>Historically informed design of sound synthesis</i> that I am part of at KTH. Vector Hack gathers researchers, developers, and
artists from around the world to investigate experimental audiovisual
works using oscilloscopes, lasers, and a variety of other
media-archaeological techniques and devices. In a true community spirit,
Vector Hack participants share ideas and develop work together alongside
a program of talks and performances.
