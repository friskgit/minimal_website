I have described what I want to accomplish in my project: a seamless integration of computer instruments in the performance of composed and improvised music. This is a fairly easily grasped aim and the problem of integration has been discussed for some time among performers, composers, improvisors and theorists <ins title="Note to myself: collect references!"></ins>. However, the question that has to be asked is why I am unsatisfied with the exisitng solutions to the problem. What is my subjective aim that proposes need for rethinking the problem?
