I have been working on the issue of musical semiology, or rather, with semiology as a possible part in a hybrid method for my artistic research project for some time now. The main reason is an article that I am writing together with Stefan &Ouml;stersj&ouml;. In the article we intend to use a semiological model to analyze composer-perfromer interaction.


The way that Eco uses semiology in the examples he brings up in "<em>La struttura assente</em>" feels to like, as a method, semiology would be a very valid choice for me.
