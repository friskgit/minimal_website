I'm doing two concerts, two productions, with <a href="http://www.emv.dk">Ensembl Midtvest</a> on July 2. It is part of the ensembles summerfestival and on the occasion I'm working with Danish video artist Anders Elberling.<h4>ABOUT THE ENSEMBLE</h4>



Young, ambitious, and dedicated. Ensemble MidtVest’s eleven players are classically trained musicians, all of whom specialize in chamber music. Eleven individuals who have won numerous prizes in international chamber music competitions, all educated at leading European music academies. Together they form a dynamic ensemble performing a huge range of chamber music on an international level.



Founded in 2002, Ensemble MidtVest consists of a string quartet, a wind quintet, and a pianist. The ensemble is renowned for its creative programming, pushing the boundaries of the traditional classical concert form through creativity and excellence.



Based in Herning, Denmark, Ensemble MidtVest resides at HEART – Herning Museum of Contemporary Art, an extraordinary venue designed by the American architect Steven Holl. The museum houses Ensemble MidtVest’s own chamber music hall and rehearsal spaces.




Ensemble MidtVest performs more than 80 concerts every year in Denmark and abroad. Each year, the ensemble performs more than 15 different programmes and productions, regularly incorporating other musical styles and art forms.  In addition to classical chamber music, Ensemble MidtVest frequently works with improvisation, creating its own sound and musical language, breaking down barriers between musical styles and genres and expanding the performers’ musical intuition and individuality. Assisting in this process, world-renowned Danish jazz pianist Carsten Dahl was appointed the ensemble’s first Artistic Advisor in 2007.



In 2006, Ensemble MidtVest’s recording of piano quartets by Mozart and Brahms was awarded a prize as the best chamber music CD of the year by the listeners of Danish Broadcasting Company. 




Ensemble MidtVest is supported financially by the music committee of the Danish Art Council and by the four municipalities of Herning, Holstebro, Ikast-Brande, and Struer. Additionally, the ensemble collaborates closely with several sponsors.
