The festival for experimental music in Kiel, [Frequenz](https://www.frequenz-kiel.de/),  presents a varied program of music, sound-art and sound installations. I played a set with a few of our students at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm as well as my collegue [Mattias Petersson](https://mattiaspetersson.bandcamp.com/). This was my first live performance on the Dataton 3000 system analog modular synthesizer and audio mixer.

Though the program featured a lot of good music one remarkable installation worth mentioning is the [Wasserorgel "h√∂rn"](https://www.kiel.de/de/kultur_freizeit/museum/_kalendereintrag.php?306426-1082252) (German only) by Torben Laib.
