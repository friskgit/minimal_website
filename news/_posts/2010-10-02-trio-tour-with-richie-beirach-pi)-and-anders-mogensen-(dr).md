I will do a short tour in Sweden and Denmark with this new trio. I have played duo with Richie (the <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=disc&about=1">CD Expressions</a> was recorded in 1997) in the past but this is the first time we play trio with Anders. Richie, whose recent week at the Birdland in New York City was a great success (featuring Randy Brecker among others) has had a lifelong commitment to jazz education and to teaching contemporary jazz improvisation and he is currently professor at the Leipzig conservatory in Germany. Anders Mogensen is one of Denmark's foremost drummers. In the late nineties we had a quartet with Gary Thomas and Michael Formanek that did several tours in Scandinavia.
