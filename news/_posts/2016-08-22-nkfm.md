The second and formative meeting for the new national network for artistic research in music, NKFM, is taking place Monday-Tuesday August 22-23 in Gothenburg. This is a very exciting event in something I initiated last year as a final activity in the artistic research school: The attempt to create a subject specific network in music that could help carry on the discussions that took place in the research school.


 On Monday night I am playing a concert with the fantastic pianist Sten Sandell at Artisten at the school for music and theatre in Gothenburg.
