SMC 2023 presents a concert in the unique environment of *Reaktorhallen* at KTH in Stockholm. Formerly the home of the first Swedish nuclear reactor is now a concert scene located 25 meters below ground. The program featured Giovanni Onorato, *licebyc~*, Juraj Kojs, *Orchid Music*, Mike Mulshine, *Fail More*, Olof Misgeld, *Dancing Dots*, and Chris Chafe's *Chopper*.

In the last piece *Chopper* I played together with Chris (located in California) and Marise van Zyl on laptop. The piece also featured the rare Wurliter organ in the hall.
