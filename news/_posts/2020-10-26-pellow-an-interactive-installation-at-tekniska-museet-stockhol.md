The installation Pellow was shown at Tekniska Museet in Stockholm in October 2020.
Pellow is a browser art installation that through sonification and visualisation lets you explore the web anew. Pellow is an installation by the <a href='https://rethread.art/'>rethread.art</a> collective in collaboration with me.
