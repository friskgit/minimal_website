Together with composer and guitarist <a href="http://www.kentolofsson.com/">Kent Olofsson</a> I will perform at the inauguration of a new center for the arts in Malmö. Inter Arts Center is co-founded by the three arts academies in Malmö (Music, Visual arts, Theater) and has an open call for projects. <a href="http://www.iac.lu.se/">Read more  about IAC here</a>.Inter Arts Center is intended as a meeting point for personnel and students at the Academies of Fine Arts, Music and Theatre who conduct experimental artistic research and development work. IAC will provide good facilities for interdisci-
plinary projects, including fine arts, music and theatre, but also other arts and disciplines. This includes projects in co-operation with artists active outside of the educational institutions.




Besides providing work spaces for artists and researchers involved in projects at the center Inter Arts Center will host externally funded artistic projects.
