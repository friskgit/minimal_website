A brand new CD from the Swedish label <a href="http://www.chambersound.se/">Chamber Music</a> featuring Swedish electro acoustic music has a recording of my piece <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=9&show=1#9">Repetition Repeats all other Repetitions</a> as played by Stefan &Ouml;stersj&ouml;. <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=9&show=1#9">Repetition Repeats all other Repetitions</a> is a piece for 10-stringed guitar and electronics that was written for Stefan. He has performed it on numerous occasions and, despite this current recording, I still regard it as a work in progress.
