MMC in Boston is now releasing the recording of my piece [Tetrachordal Variations]({% link _recordings/17.md %}) as played by the Warszaw Phil. and myself and Richie Beirach as soloists. The recordings were made in 1996. Keep posted for release date!


This recording was made a long time ago. Nevertheless, I am really happy it will be released now finally. I think Richie Beirach is playing really great on this and, although I don't write in this style much anymore, it will be interesting to see what reactions I get from this.
