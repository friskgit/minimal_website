On Thursday January 24 I will be playing at <a href="http://www.glennmillercafe.com/gmc.html">GMC</a> in Stockholm with Peter Nilsson on drums and Nils Ölmedal on bass.<br />
I have played with Peter Nilsson for more than a decade and he is one of my favourite musicians. At this event we will play some originals by me but also some Ornette Coleman tunes and other moderns standards.
