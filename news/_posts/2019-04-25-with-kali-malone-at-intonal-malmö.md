Making a brief performance with Kali Malone at the <a href="http://www.intonalfestival.com/schedule/">Intonal festival in Malmö</a>. The concert takes place at the wonderful Johanneskyrkan near Triangeln in central town. Kali's set starts at 20:30.With a special interest in church organs and organ tuning, Kali's music is building on the renewed interest in just intonation following great American composers such as Harry Partch. Check out Kali's music at <a href="https://kalimalone.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>.
