My piece <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=22&show=1#22">Image Schema</a> is being performed at the <a href="https://www.misomusic.me/musicavivafestival/20211113">Festival Musica Viva</a> in Lisbon Potugal on November 13 at 19:30 (Portugal time). The concert is being streamed online for those you interested to hear. There are several other interesting intermedia pieces in the concert as well!The Musica Viva Festival is a part of the European project <a href="https://eastndc.eu/">EASTN-DC</a> and within the same project, together with Kim HedÃ¥s,  I am also curating a festival in Stockholm November 22-24 at KMH, The Royal College of Music.
