At 14:15 on May 24 starts a mini conference with many interesting speakers such as Atau Tanaka, Professor of Media Computing, Dept of Computing, Goldsmiths, Univ of London and Roger Dannenberg, Professor of Computer Science, Art, and Music Carnegie Mellon University, USA. I will be presenting my ongoing work on a documentation database for artistic practice.
ArtDoc: An experimental archive for artistic practice



See <a href="https://www.kth.se/mid/calendar/seminars">this link for more information.</a>Abstract




ArtDoc is an experimental archive primarily for the purpose of documenting artistic practice. One of the ambitions is to address the question of how artistic practice may be documented in a manner that makes visible the processes in action. ArtDoc has its roots in research and artistic practice that began over ten years ago and preliminary tests shows it to be a useful complement to other means to document musical works and artistic processes. The particular case of open form works, works that in some respect are negotiated between the different agents involved, such as composers, musicians and members of the audience, was a point of departure and has guided the development to a significant degree. The underlying structure of documentation classes is discussed and an example of how the archive may be used in connection with the speaker dome Klangkupolen in Lilla Salen at the Royal college of music is presented.
