The Six Tones is a Swedish-Vietnamese project featuring Stefan Östersjö, Nguyen Thanh Thuy and Ngo Tra My. On this tour, starting March 28 in Stockholm and ending April 4 in Härnösand, Henrik Frisk will also perform live electronics with the trio, in his own piece as well as in improvisations. The collaboration started in the spring of 2006 with the main ambition to create a foundation for a meeting between two different musical cultures on equal terms. An other ambition with The Six Tones has been to reach beyond merely a superimposition of elements and strive for a more coherent and experimentally oriented sound. From this point of departure Henrik Frisk composed a trio for Dan Tranh, Dan Bau, banjo, e-bow, 10-stringed guitar and electronics premiered at a concert in Hanoi in October -06. The improvisations over traditional Vietnamese music - also part of the touring program - have been important guiding posts while navigating this difficult territory.
