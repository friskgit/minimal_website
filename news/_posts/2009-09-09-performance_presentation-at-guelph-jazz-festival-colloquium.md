On Thursday September 10 (also the birthday of my youngest son!) I will be doing a performance presentation at the Guelph Jazz Festival Colloquium in Canada. The performance is done together with Dutch music philosopher <a href="http://www.cobussen.com/">Marcel Cobussen</a>.The Colloquium is part of the <a href="http://www.guelphjazzfestival.com/">Guelph Jazz Festival</a>. Our presentation/performance is an experimental attempt at combining two modes of thinking; one text based and one sound based, into one. The topic is music and ethics and one of the angles we take is the concept of non-listening in the context of improvisation.


The featured keynote speaker at the Colloquium is the distinguished American drummer and percussionist <a href="http://www.milfordgraves.com/">Milford Graves</a>.
