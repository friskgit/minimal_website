As part of the European arts and culture project <a href="https://www.kmh.se/forskning/pagaende-forsknings-projekt/eastn-dc.html">EASTN-DC</a> we are presenting a week of discussions, workshops and premieres at KMH in Stockholm. My artistic contribution is an ongoing project that takes its departure in field recordings made in and around the KMH campus. These are used to create a virtual sonic space that allows the listener to be at several places at the same time, metaphorically speaking. It is also an attempt to find the musicality in the the fieldrecordings and attempt to draw the listener into a state of musical listening; in short to explore the space inbetween the sonic and the musical spaces. The piece is both a concert piece and an installation that invites the listener to move between two concert halls and the space inbetween these.Read more about <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=20&show=1#20">Locomotion here</a>.
