On June 7 I will do a concert at the <a href="http://www.violacongress2006.ca/">International Viola Congress</a> in Montreal together with Swedish viola player <a href="http://www.frendin.com">Henrik Frendin</a>. 



The concert starts at 10:30 and was originally to be held at Lion d'Or, but has been moved. Check the <a href="http://www.violacongress2006.ca/">program</a> for updates.
At the concert we will perform music by Paul Dolden, Kent Olofsson and a couple of pieces by me. Here's a short <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&amp;id=music&amp;about=1&amp;field=name&amp;query=Drive">video clip</a> of the recording of my composition <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&amp;id=comp&amp;about=1&amp;field=id&amp;query=1">Drive</a> when performed by Henrik Frendin.
