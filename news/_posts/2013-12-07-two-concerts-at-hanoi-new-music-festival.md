<h2>9:30pm – Saturday, Dec. 7th 2013</h2>
<h2>Venue: Tadioto - 2nd Floor, Block A, 9 Tran Thanh Tong</h2>

From the program:



"The 1960s and ‘70s witnessed numerous revolutions and radical social change. Natural and man-made sounds and noises - the outsiders of classical music history - were no longer rejected, but were even embraced as material and a new standard for aesthetics and philosophy of music. That approach entered the 21st century on a diverse and volatile basis with the support of the scientific and technical achievements in the digital era. Come and join the evening of electronic music by representative Vietnamese and international electronic musicians, to enjoy various electronic music styles and experience a space of sounds in which The Rest Is Noise."
