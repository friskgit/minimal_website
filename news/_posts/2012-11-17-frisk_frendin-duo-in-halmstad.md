The live show may be seen at Stadsbiblioteket in Halmstad, Nissanscenen, Saturday November 17 at 18:00.Using a wide variety of sources for their improvisations on viola, saxophones and electronics, the program will be a veritable melting pot of styles and idioms stretching through the roaring silence.
