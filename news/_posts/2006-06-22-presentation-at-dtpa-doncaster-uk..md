Myself and Stefan &Ouml;stersj&ouml; have been invited to do a presentation of our paper "Negotiating the musical work (II): Computer-Performer interaction in Relation to Composer-Performer Interaction."This is our (very short) abstract for the conference:


In this paper we explore the inter-relations between performer and
composer, aiming at a closer understanding of the significance of
their negotiations. We approach this area empirically by analyzing
video from a performer-composer collaboration. This data is also used
in a discussion of the interaction between computer and performer.
