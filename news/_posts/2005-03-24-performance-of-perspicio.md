Stockholm Saxophone Quartet will perform my piece <a href="index.jsp?metaId=music&amp;id=comp&amp;field=id&amp;query=3">Perspicio</a> at the <a href="http://www.musikisyd.se/samarbeten.asp?pid=borderline">Borderline</a> festival in Malm&ouml;.

I will also be performing at some of the other concerts in the Malm&ouml; Liberation Orchestra. The exact time and location of these concerts is not fixed yet so stay tuned for more info...

 


One of the invited artists this year is the Canadian composer Paul Dolden. He is an extraordinary artist - don't miss the concerts of his music.
