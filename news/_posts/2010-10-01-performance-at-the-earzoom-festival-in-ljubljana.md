<h3>2. - 7. October 2010, Ljubljana, Slovenia</h3>

IRZU â€“ the Institute for sonic Arts Research was founded in 2008 in Ljubljana with the aim of filling a local content gap in the interdisciplinary field of contemporary sonic arts. Our activities cover the following three main areas: audio technology research (digital signal processing, sonic interaction design, music information retrieval, non-linear acoustics, etc.), artistic productions (performances, exhibitions, installations, films) and educational projects (lectures, workshops), which are mostly aimed at transmitting basic knowledge on the use of digital technologies and conceptual approaches in sonic arts, to local composers and inter-media artists.
