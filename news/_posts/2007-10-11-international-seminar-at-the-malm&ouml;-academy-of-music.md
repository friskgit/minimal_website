<em>As one part of our centenary celebrations we arrange a conference in Malmö, October, 11-12. The
conference, The International Seminar on the Education and Performance of Music starts in the morning
Thursday Oct 11 at 11 am and finishes Friday 12 at 3 pm. One point of departure for some of the
presentations and discussions will be the book A Decade of Research in Music Education, launched at
the start of the conference and summarizing the music education research conducted in Malmö/Lund
during the past ten years. Another point of departure is the experiences from the development and the
first years of artistic research in music at the Malmö Academy of Music.
All presentations and discussions will be in plenum, with good time for discussions. Each session starts
with a 30-minute presentation followed by 45-60 minutes of discussion and comments.
