During the joint conference SMAC/SMC organized by KTH myself and Bill Brunson are curating three concerts for 26 speakers at KMH July 30 through August 1.Sound Science, Sound Experience<br/>
During the past five decades, the domain of Music Acoustics has widened from studies of the acoustics of musical instruments and voice, including basic elements of musical perception and performance, to investigations of how humans experience and interact with sounds and music. Increasingly, the knowledge is put into industrial, societal and psychological perspectives.
