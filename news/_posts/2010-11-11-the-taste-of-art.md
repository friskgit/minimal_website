Some of the pieces I've done in collaboration with Swedish artist Stefan Lundgren will be played at his event The Taste of Art at <a href="http://www.pelaires.com/>Pelaires Centre Cultural Contemporani</a>. At this happening Stefan Lundgren will transform five of his works into food.I have collaborated with Stefan for almost 20 years and together we have done installations and performances in Sweden, Germany, Bella Russia and Spain. One of our more recent collaborations is documented in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9ZttCunw_Q">this short YouTube clip</a>.
