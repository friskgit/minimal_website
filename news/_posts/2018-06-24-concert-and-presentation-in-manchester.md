In the coming week I will be in Manchester at the NOVARS Research Centre (MUSIC) at the University of Manchester for the EASTN-DC festival of Digital Creativity. Read more at the <a href="http://eastn.uk/about">Manchester EASTN-DC site</a> where you can also find the full program.



A recent - the first performance of this version - piece by Mongrel (Henrik Frisk and Anders Elberling), <em>Machinic Propositions</em> will be performed.<h3>WHAT IS EASTN-DC ?</h3>
The European Art - Science - Technology Network (EASTN) for Digital Creativity is a project that emerged from several European institutions involved in research, technology development, creation and education in the field of technologies applied to artistic creation. At European Level, this network is coordinated by ACROE (Grenoble, France) and supported by the Culture Program of the European Union. Since its launch in January 2014, this network has allowed the reception in residence of 40 European artists or collectives, and the creation of many unique pieces.

<h3>WHY IS IT COMING TO MANCHESTER?</h3>
The NOVARS Research Centre (MUSIC) at the University of Manchester is one of the 14 European Institutions involved in the EASTN-DC Network. We are very proud to be organising the first full-week Network event during 25-30 June 2018.
