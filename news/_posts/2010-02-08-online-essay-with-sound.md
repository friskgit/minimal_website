An essay by Marcel Cobussen for which I did a "sound illustration" is now available online as part of <a href="">Volume 2 of the interdisciplinary e-journal Konturen</a>, "Between
Nature and Culture: After the Continental-Analytic Divide," . The title of the piece (which we've also performed live at the Guelph Jazz Festival last year) is <a href="http://musicalimprovisation.free.fr/index.php">The Field of Musical Improvisation</a> and it's a collaboration between myself, <a href="http://www.cobussen.com/">Marcel Cobussen</a> and Bart Weijland.

<h3>Abstract</h3>



In this essay the first initiatives are presented to come to a new theoretical approach of musical improvisation. The main idea is to regard musical improvisation as a nonlinear dynamical system in which various (f)actors interact and connect in complex ways. In other words, the Field of Musical Improvisation (FMI) has no stable or strict identity.
