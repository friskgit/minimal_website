I will do a performance and a presentation at the <a href=http://www.elia-artschools.org/Activities/11th+ELIA+Biennial+Conference&needsclass=1">ELIA Biennal Conference</a> in Nantes. Apart from a short improvisation I will present my paper "Time and Reciprocity".The European League of Institutes of the Arts, ELIA, represents approximately 350 Higher Arts Education Institutes training artists at a professional level coming from all disciplines in the Arts (Fine Art, Design, Theatre, Music, Dance, Media Arts, Architecture) and from 47 countries.
