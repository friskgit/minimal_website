This edition of <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=proj&about=0&field=id&query=4">The Six Tones</a> features apart from Stefan Östersjö and I, Nguyen Thanh Thuy (Dan Tranh) and Tri Minh (laptop).

  for New Music Development</h3>


<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The idea of the Kalv Festival is 
  to create a forum where new music can develop and reach new audiences. The festival 
  was held for the first time in 2004, and is an annual event. </font>


<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to concerts we want to 
  create a forum and a form for development with the aim of strengthening the 
  position of contemporary music in society. With this in mind we have set up 
  the Project Lab, where ensembles, composers, and anyone who works with new music 
  can run their own development projects in cooperation with people who work in 
  other areas of society. These might include both other art forms, science, social 
  institutions, trade and industry etc. The Kalv Festival will be a meeting-point 
  and a reporting forum for the Project Lab.</font>


<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Kalv meeting-point will also 
  offer organisations from musical life the opportunity to meet for conferences 
  and seminars, and forge new contacts. Some of the seminars will be open to the 
  public and linked to the festival itself.</font>


<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Kalv Festival is being arranged 
  by the Kalvfestivalen society with support from Region V&auml;stra G&ouml;taland, 
  Rikskonserter, Svenljunga municipality, the Swedish National Council for Cultural 
  Affairs, The Royal Swedish Academy of Music, Levande Musik, the School of Music 
  and Music Education at G&ouml;teborg University, Bor&aring;s Art Museum, the Kalv Village Community 
  and others.</font>


<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>THE KALV MEETING-POINT</b><br>
  The Kalv Festival offers a meeting-point for organisations from musical life 
  and for people interested in music. We believe that new music is best developed 
  in the encounter between composers, musicians, audiences and society. By holding 
  ordinary board meetings, conferences, etc in Kalv, contact with other people 
  active in the field of new music can be spontaneous and congenial.</font>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also invite members of the public 
  with an interest in music to join us in Kalv to attend a series of seminars 
  around the festival's concerts.</font>


<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>THE PROJECT LAB </b><br>
  The Project lab is the part of the Kalv Festival that runs the whole year, offering 
  the opportunity to run development projects where ensembles, composers, arrangers, 
  etc. cooperate with branches of knowledge in the humanities, natural sciences 
  or social sciences and/or with other forms of art, crafts, trade and industry 
  etc. The Kalv festival will mark the beginning and conclusion of the projects. 
  The aim of the Project Lab is to channel creative support from other areas of 
  society to the new art of music, just as society will benefit from new music's 
  specific way of formulating our contemporary reality.</font>
