lim with Marc Ducret documents the continued collaboration between <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=proj&about=1&field=id&query=1">lim</a> and French guitarist Marc Ducret. The ongoing collaboration was initiated during KOPAfestival 2006 and parts of their 2006 performance is also featured on the CD KOPAlectric. Although the fourth CD by <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=proj&about=1&field=id&query=1">lim</a> this new album is the first studio recording with Ducret. 



<a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=proj&about=1&field=id&query=1">lim</a>Â´s music and unique sound is the result of a committed and long-term group effort that was initiated over decade ago. This recording clearly shows that the music of this group continues to evolve while, at the same time, their expression has been refined. Despite the complexity of both the compositions and the interplay, lim & Ducret manages to create music that is both organic, original, dynamic and engaging and feels personal, vital, creative, challenging and urgent. This recording is an sincere artistic imprint and marks a new take-off for the band in its quartet version.
