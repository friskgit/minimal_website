Performing solo laptop on an eight channel system at <a href="http://www.pi.lu.se/">Pufendorf Insitute in Lund</a> at 19.00. This is the first performance of <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=15&show=1#15">Opposite of Black Noise</a> in Sweden.Performances at events such as Kulturnatten are challenging in the way that the audience can be just about anyone passing by. Most of the time I play for an audience that know what to expect at a new music concert, but at a concert such as this I have to think differently. I see this as a great and interesting challenge, one that I have become increasingly interested in.
