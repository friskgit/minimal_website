The Audio paper <a href="https://seismograf.org/fokus/sonic-argumentation-i/frisk_thuy">Found in translation</a> published by the peer-reviewed platform for contemporary music and sound art, Seismograf, earlier this year is broadcasted by <a href="https://fr-bb.org/programm/sendung/44549.html#Seismograf%20%252f%20Sonic%20Argumentation-Part%202">fr-bb on February 11 at 15:00</a>. The presentation of these ten new audio papers is the continuation of the exploration of the audio paper format. The publications are both a result of the individual research processes, and are, as a whole, illustrating the many possibilities of a format, where sound, time, timbre, rhythm, simultaneity and complex dramaturgy are refining, and perhaps re-defining, how an academic argument can be presented.The audio paper, just as its companion format of the video essay (Kiss and Berg, 2016), is indeed creating new avenues for practice-based research fields to interact with the larger community in novel ways. But furthermore, this movement away from the hegemony of the written word towards sonic and visual modes of communication holds a promise for an acknowledgement of the transmodal nature of human perception, and an embodied understanding of knowledge, in academia, in the arts and in everyday life.
