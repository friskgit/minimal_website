June 9 I will be playing with guitarist <a href="http://www.myspace.com/andersnilsson">Anders Nilsson</a> at <a href="http://www.cafegrumpy.com">Café Grumpy </a> in Brooklyn. More details on the concert can be found <a href="http://collect.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=music.showDetails&Band_Show_ID=5080767&friendid=76660380">here</a>.<a href="http://www.kopasetic.se/"><image src="http://cdbaby.name/a/o/aorta2.jpg"></img></a>
Me and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/andersnilsson">Anders</a> have played together on many different occasions since the early 90's. I'm very much looking forward to this performance. In 2001 I did a tour in Sweden with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/andersnilsson">Anders Nilsson</a> and the band "no-tone". He is an extraordinary musician and his own band, "Aorta" has just released its second cd. <a href="http://www.kopasetic.se/">Check it out!</a> It's truly great music.
