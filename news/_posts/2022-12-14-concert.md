Thursday, December 15, 7:30pm PST
[CCRMA Stage](https://music.stanford.edu/venues-facilities/venues/ccrma-stage) | [CCRMA LIVE](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/live/)

FREE and Open to the Public. The concert is streamed (see link above under CCRMA Live) and broadcast on radio by KFJC.

In the concert I will play <a href="{% link _portfolio/23_for_bill.md %}">For Bill, Rising</a> and the first performance of Concinnity for saxophone and electronics as well as Nu by <a href="kimhedas.se">Kim Hed√•s</a>. The concert will also include an improvisation session by Henrik on saxophone with guests from the CCRMA community: Constantin Basica, Chris Chafe, and Fernando Lopez-Lezcano.

This is the last event for me in California before I go back to Sweden.

Tune in!
