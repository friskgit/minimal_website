I'm proud to be part of the two day electroacoustic outdoor mini festival *Transitions* at [CCRMA, Stanford](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/events/ccrma-transitions-2022). Other participants include John Chowning, Mark Applebaum and Celeste Betancour.

The video piece [Elle a dans√©, il se tourna](http://www.henrikfrisk.com/portfolio/16_tourna/) by [Mongrel](http://www.henrikfrisk.com/portfolio/15_mongrel/) (a collaboration I have with Danish photographer and video artist Anders Elberling) will be performed on a 28.4 system and a single video screen. I'm looking forward to two nice warm evenings with lots of great music and talks.
