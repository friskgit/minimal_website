# Online performance: Quarantine sessions

On October 30 I am playing with the Quarantine Sessions, *A Distributed Electroacoustic Network Improvisation*, together with Ryan Wixen, and the original members Constantin Basica (Stanford, CA), Chris Chafe (Woodside, CA), Fernando Lopez-Lezcano (San Carlos, CA) and Juan Parra (Ghent, BE).

All really nice musicians, nice interplay and an online performance situation that actually worked! [Listen to it on JackTrip radio](https://jacktrip.radio/r/sGxmonEv_YlXdPwHA1m4w).
