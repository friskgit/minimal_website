My piece for guitar and electronics, <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=8&show=1#8">Repetition Repeats all Other Repetitions</a> will be performed by Stefan &Ouml;stersj&ouml; in two different versions at two concerts at Stanford and Seattle in February.



For more information about the venues look <a href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/concerts/c_schedule.html">here for the February 8</a> concert at <a href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/">CCRMA, Stanford</a>, and <a href="http://www.washington.edu/dxarts/">here for the February 11</a> concert at <a href="http://www.washington.edu/dxarts/">DXARTS</a>, Seattle. I'm very excited about the new version we, myself and Stefan, have done of <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=8&show=1#8">Repetition...</a> We've made it to the classic dadaist film <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvDGcu4O3v8">Symphonie Diagonale</a> by the Swedish artist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Eggeling">Viking Eggeling</a> because of the conceptual similarities between the two works. The result is somewhat of a collage of audio and video.

(2003-04)</li>
