lim with Marc Ducret documents the continued collaboration between lim and
French guitarist Marc Ducret. The on going collaboration was initiated during
KOPAfestival 2006 and parts of their 2006 performance is also featured on the
CD KOPAlectric. Although the fourth CD by lim this new album is the first
studio recording with Ducret. 



lim´s music and unique sound is the result of a committed and long-term group
effort that was initiated over decade ago. This recording clearly shows that
the music of this group continues to evolve while, at the same time, their
expression has been refined. Despite the complexity of both the compositions
and the interplay, lim & Ducret manages to create music that is both organic,
original, dynamic and engaging and feels personal, vital, creative,
challenging and urgent. This recording is an sincere artistic imprint and
marks a new take-off for the band in its quartet version.



The CD was recorded live in front of an audience in Gula Studion in Malmö,
Sweden, during two nights in November 2010.
