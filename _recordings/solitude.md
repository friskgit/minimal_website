The Inventions of Solitude was Henrik Frisks first release on the Canadian recording label <cite>Hornblower Recordings</cite>. It features a series of solo saxophone improvisations, some using overdubs and electronics, by Henrik Frisk and a very interesting piece, <cite>Saxony</cite>, by James Tenney for saxophone and tape delay system. The music was recorded in 1995 at the Banff Centre for the Arts in Canada.
