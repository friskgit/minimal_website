<h2>Program note (EN)</h2>
These improvisations are each exploring one possible range of sounds on the saxophone. This being the only limitation, the computer part is designed so that it will work with a limited set of sonic real time permutations on the input. The computer 'performer' is deriving all control data from the audio input.



Although in some of these improvisations the computer may play a somewhat independent part, my main intent with using the computer in this context is to expand the range of possible sounds on the saxophone. Using mainly Max/MSP I am aiming at designing an interface between the saxophone and the computer that is as transparent as possible - to myself as the performer as well as to the listener.
