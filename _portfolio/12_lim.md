lim is a collective band playing improvised and metaphysical music. As a trio we have been playing since 1997 but in 2013 we were joined by guitarist Samuel Hällqvist. As a group lim has always worked long and hard on the music in order to achieve the utmost level of spontaneity within the sometimes complex structures.

Their first cd, <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=disc&about=1&field=id&query=9">lim</a>, was released on the Swedish label <a href="http://www.db-productions.se/flash.html">dB Productions</a> in 2002 and is a studio production in which the recording studio is treated as an instrument in its own respect. 

Their second album, <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=disc&about=1&field=id&query=11">Superlim</a>, which was released on <a href="http://www.kopasetic.se">Kopasetic Productions</a> in 2006 has a more relaxed live feel to it and is quite different from the first one. The music is still to a large extent focused on rhythmical aspects, but the sound of the group is less dense then it was on their <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=disc&about=1&field=id&query=9">first CD</a>.
