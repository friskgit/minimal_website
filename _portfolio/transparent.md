<h2>Program note (EN)</h2>
The title alludes to the objectivist standpoint where the self is observing rather than projecting itself. The american writer Henry David Thoreau is a representative for a nondual view of man and nature, Thoreau is merelely the medium, not the subject. I have long been interested in the idea of the self as something that easily gets in the way. Improvisation, the way I look at it, is a method where the self can destroy the potential openness of a situation. A self that projects itself is a self that may attempt to control a situation whose life depend on its relative freedom. When composing for an ensemble allowing for improvisation is particularly dificult as the balance between instructions and creative freedom needs to be carefully negotiated. As romantic as it may be, the following quote from Thoreau's Walden speaks of this continuum from familiar to distant:




I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents
of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle
of God. The name of the nearest friend sounds then foreign and
accidental: to be brothers, to be acquaintances, master or servant,
is then a trifle and a disturbance. I am the lover of uncontained and
immortal beauty.




The form of the piece does not have to be linear. The improvised material in the second section can be inserted into the first section in any order at the indicated points (A1, A2, etc and B1/B2, B3/B4, etc). Or, the piece may begin with material from the second section. The form may be rehearsed or improvised in the performance. In the latter case it may be necessary to make up signs for the various elements of the piece. For example, the conductor could indicate a move to a given A section with the left hand and a move to a given B section with the right hand.
