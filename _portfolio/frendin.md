Together with Swedish violist <a href="http://www.frendin.com/">Henrik Frendin</a>, I perform contemporary composed and improvised music. We work extensively with real time electronics. We have performed in Sweden, Iceland, Germany, Denmark, Canada and USA. <a href="http://www.frendin.com/">Henrik Frendin</a> plays Viola, Viola d'amore and his custom built Electric Viola Grande - a five string electric viola.  Depending on the program, I play saxophones and laptop.

Some musical examples.
