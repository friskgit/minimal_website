<h2>Program note (EN)</h2>
Drinking is based on a concept by Bill Brooks and "A Drinking Song" by W. B. Yeats:

"After Yeats is not a score for performance but rather a method for
determining a score; it extends W. B. Yeats’s practice of poetic
declamation to languages other than English. After Yeats describes a
collaboration between a performer, who declaims a Yeats poem in translation, self-accompanied by a plucked string instrument, and a composer, who works at a remove to observe and amplify the
implications of the declamation."
