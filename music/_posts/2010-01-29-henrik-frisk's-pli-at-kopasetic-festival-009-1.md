This is a video from the premiere of my band Pli. The concert was held at Victoriateatern in MalmÃ¶ and features some of my favorite musicians. This tune is an arrangement and re-composition that I did of the jazz standard <it>Like Someone in Love</it> onto which we superimpose the original song by Jimmy van Heusen. The solo in the middle is a trio with Sten Sandell on piano, myself on tenor and Peter Nilsson on drums.
