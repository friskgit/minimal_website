*This is a binaural mix of the original version which was composed for a 29 spearker array. The music is best listened to on headphones.*

The title of this piece refers to my friend Bill (Brunson) and composer Jim Tenney (the reference in the title being to his piece "For Ann, Rising") both of whom have been incredibly important to me. The basic musical idea behind this composition is to use a simple synthesis model and create timbral variations through combining repetitions of the original sound. The tonality and the rhythms are both derived from a 7-limit, 11-note scale. In the piece rhythms are treated as slowed down intervals and vice versa.
