[Drinking](%{ link _portfolio/drinking.md %}) is originally a piece for electronics, voice and Dan Tranh (a Vietnamese zither), but also other instrumentations are possible. It was created as part of a collaboration between The Six Tones (www.thesixtones.org), a Vietnamese/Swedish ensemble of which both Nguyen Thanh Thuy (the dan tranh player) and I, the composer, are a part of and William Brooks. Brooks is a composer and professor at the University of York. This recording features Nguyen Than Thuy and was done in Malm√∂ in 2019.
