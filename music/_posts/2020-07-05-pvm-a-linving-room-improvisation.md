A living room improvisation on materials recorded in Vietnam in 2019. These recordings wa made as part of the Transformations project, an artistic research project that investigates the impact of musical traditions in transformation. The improv was made using software that I have composed myself in PureData, Max, Supercollider and Faust. I play on a QuNeo pad and a laptop.

This piece has been performed a few times, among other places at the conference for AI music at KTH in the fall of 2020.
