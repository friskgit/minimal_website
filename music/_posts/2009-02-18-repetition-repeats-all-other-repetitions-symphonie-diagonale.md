This is a recording of the version of my piece for Stefan Östersjö, [Repetition Repeats all other Repetitions]({% link _portfolio/10_repetitions.md %}) made for the classic avant garde film <em>Symponie Diagonale</em> by <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Eggeling">Viking Eggeling</a>. Stefan and I collaboratively produced this version in early 2007 and it has been performed by Stefan on numerous occasions in Sweden, UK and USA.
