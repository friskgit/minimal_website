Music to a video created by Johan Fröst. The visual material is a processed recording of Fröst playing piano music  by Debussy. I have not used the original music as my point of departure, rather I have exclusively looked at the images and extracted the form from the changes in the film. The film was the mediator between the original piano music and this electronic score. This piece was premiered in Engelbrektskyrkan in Stockholm on Nowember 24.
