In January I did three solo saxophone & laptop concerts in Sweden. The following two track are from the concert at Artisten in Gothenburg on January 13. In these tracks, the only input to the computer except for what I play is a pedal that I use to control start and stop. All other parameters that control the synthesis, sampling, playing and spatialisation are derived from what I play.
