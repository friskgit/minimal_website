The first recording I will make available here is a recording I did a few weeks ago together with soprano and baritone saxophonist Andreas Andersson. We started a duo a while ago which we call MSQ (Malm&ouml; Saxophone Quartet). The name obviously doesn't refer to the number of musicians but rather to the fact that, between the two of us, we play soprano, alto, tenor and baritone. <br />We recorded some standards and some more freely improvised stuff with the ambition to explore the term <cite>free</cite> in the context of improvisation. Some of the discussions we had leading up to this recording will be reflected in my <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/diary/">diary</a>.
